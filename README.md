# Vulkan Sandbox

This is my vulkan sandbox. I'm trying to learn vulkan and this is my progress so far.  
The code here is just the basics for rendering a triangle + some custom code to work with 
my i3wm setup.  
I might work on this sporadically so this is mostly a backup for me.  

The code is (mostly) organized and (mostly) adheres to my code quality standards. 
Basically, vulkan/initialization.rs handles all the low-level stuff that should mostly be write once then forget 
until it explodes.  

Everything *"should"* run with `cargo run` but I can't guarantee it.
